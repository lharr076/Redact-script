# Redact-script
 Over last week I wanted to make a script to be able redact IP address from a log text file

 What I like aobut this script is with a creative mind, the wielder can modify the script to redact whatever they need to their liking with some modification

 To use this script is pretty simple:

 1- Drop the script in your respective folder with the text file you want to redact
 2- Open the script in your respective IDE and modify your parameters to your liking and save the file
 3- open the command prompt as Administrator to create the text file. and enter 'python redact.py'
 4- The script will run and save the new text file with all parameters chosen to be redacted redacted in the same folder as the script
